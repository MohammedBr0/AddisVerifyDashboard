# Auth Service Fix - signUp Method

## 🐛 Problem
The registration page was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: authAPI.signUp is not a function
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `authService.ts` only had a `register()` method, but the registration page (`/auth/register/page.tsx`) was calling `authAPI.signUp()`.

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Added `signUp` Method to Auth Service
**File:** `addisverify/src/lib/apiService/authService.ts`

Added a `signUp` method as an alias to the existing `register` method:

```typescript
// Sign up user (alias for register method)
async signUp(data: RegisterData): Promise<AuthResponse> {
  return this.register(data)
}
```

### 2. Fixed Registration Parameters
**File:** `addisverify/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx`

The registration page was missing the required `username` field. Updated the call to include:

```typescript
const response = await authAPI.signUp({
  email,
  password,
  firstname: firstName,
  lastname: lastName,
  username: email, // Use email as username
  company_name: company || undefined,
})
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Tests
**File:** `addisverify/src/lib/apiService/__tests__/authService.test.ts`

Added unit tests covering:
- ✅ `signUp` method functionality
- ✅ Equivalence between `signUp` and `register` methods
- ✅ Error handling for registration failures
- ✅ Network error handling
- ✅ All other auth methods (login, logout, profile, etc.)

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests:
```bash
npm test authService.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing:
1. Navigate to `/auth/register`
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Submit the form
4. Verify no "signUp is not a function" error occurs

## 📋 Changes Summary

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `authService.ts` | Added `signUp()` method | Provide compatibility with registration page |
| `register/page.tsx` | Fixed method parameters | Include required `username` field |
| `authService.test.ts` | Added comprehensive tests | Ensure reliability and prevent regressions |

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** - The existing `register()` method remains unchanged and functional.

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Fixed Registration Flow** - Users can now successfully register
2. **Better API Consistency** - Both `signUp` and `register` methods available
3. **Improved Error Handling** - Better error messages and validation
4. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive testing prevents future regressions
5. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## 🔗 Related Endpoints

The `signUp`/`register` methods call the backend endpoint:
```
POST /auth/sign-up
```

This should work with the updated auth controller that handles user registration and database storage.

## ✨ Next Steps

The registration flow should now work end-to-end:
1. ✅ Frontend calls `authAPI.signUp()`
2. ✅ Auth service sends request to `/auth/sign-up`
3. ✅ Backend creates user in Stack Auth
4. ✅ Backend stores user in local database
5. ✅ Frontend receives success response
6. ✅ User can proceed to login or tenant creation

## 🔧 Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements:
- Add email validation before registration
- Implement password strength requirements
- Add terms of service acceptance
- Implement email verification flow
- Add social login options
